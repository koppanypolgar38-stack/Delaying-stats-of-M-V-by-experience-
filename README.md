# Delaying-stats-of-M-V-by-experience-
In this repository I made an investigation of Hungary's national railway companies delaing stats, using my own experiences.  
At the end of each travel I noted how much have been the train delayd.
At the end of the year I made a statistical analysis, using excel.
I found out that the official stats and my experiences aren't really correlate. It is probably because most of my stats created from the Budapest-Szombathely line and thats relatively longer than most of the hungarian railvay lines. For this reason the train has more opportunity to combine "faults", and dealay more. I assume that is the reason why I experienced more delays above 20 minutes than the official stats.
I also tried to find correlation between some outside influence, and the dealiyng time, by using excel's built-in correlation function. But unfortunately the datas aren't really match. The strongest correlation is between the temperature, and the delaying time, but that is only -0.25. That is far away from -0.7 which is considered as hard correlation. 
From 2026 I trie to combining more datas about the current weather, and the number of passengers on very single route. Number of passangers is an estimated data, because I assume that the number of passengers in every carriage is infuenced by uniqe distribution.
